        <h1>All about fireworks!</h1>
        <h2 class="fun_facts">Fun facts</h2>
        <ul class="fun_facts">
            <li>The birth of fireworks can be traced back to 7th century China. But there is further evidence that primitive Chinese firecrackers date back as far as 200BC. It is thought that a Chinese cook accidentally invented gunpowder by mixing three common kitchen ingredients! Today, it is estimated that China produces around 90% of the world’s fireworks.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Although fireworks were probably used in the UK from the late 13th century onwards, they didn’t become popular until at least 200 years later. The first documented use of fireworks in the UK is at the wedding of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, in 1486. The marriage marked the union of the long-sparring Yorkist and Lancastrian families, bringing peace after years of dynastic war. A suitable occasion for a pyrotechnic party!</li>
            <br>
            <li>It wasn’t until the reign of Queen Elizabeth I that fireworks really took off (excuse the pun) across the nation. The queen found them so thrilling that she created the position of “Fire Master of England”. As the best and most respected fireworks-maker in England, he took charge of all royal displays.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Shakespeare refers to fireworks in a number of his plays, suggesting that they were widely used by his lifetime. In Love’s Labour’s Lost one character states, “the king would have me present the princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or antique, or firework.”</li>
            <br>
            <li>A shell that emits stars in a perfect circle, with the brightness growing as the circle gets bigger, is called a “chrysanthemum”. A firework that has stars that fly outward, then start to descend, is called a “peony”. And multiple breaks of small chrysanthemums is called a “bouquet”. Other exotic firework names include the “butterfly”, the “coconut palm” and “dragon's eggs” – characteristically a gold or silver breaking effect that ends in crackles or strobes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>These days, we use the expression “damp squib” to describe a disappointing event that is not as exciting or impressive as expected. But a squib is literally a miniature explosive device, or form of firework, usually cylindrical in shape and with a paper fuse at one end, which fails to ignite if it gets wet. (The phrase is commonly misquoted as “damp squid”, but of course we all know cephalopods are big fans of water.)</li>
            <br>
            <li>According to Guinness World Records the biggest ever fireworks display was achieved by Iglesia Ni Cristo (Church of Christ) in the Philippines, who welcomed 2016 in with a record-breaking bang. The display lasted for 1 hour, 1 minute and 32.35 seconds and, sadly, it poured with rain the whole way through.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The Walt Disney Company is said to be the largest consumer of fireworks in the world. It is estimated that they spend around $50 million a year on their displays. That’s no Mickey Mouse operation!</li>
            <h2>Top five fireworks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>500g Finale Cake is another perennial customer favorite. There is something about 16 shots of huge gold willow breaks with crackling flowers that keeps people smiling. One Bad Mother only features one color and is still the baddest firework in town!</li>
                <br>
                <li>500 gram finale cake has been a customer favorite for many years. Loyal To None is an exciting finale firework with 33 shots and lasts well over a minute. Lots of color mixed with unique effects make this one a perennial all star!</li>
                <br>
                <li>500 gram Multi-shot cake - Another very exciting firework with lots of action plus red, white, and blue colors - perfect for the Fourth Of July. Effects from ground to sky with blue mines, pigeon blood red dahlia breaks, and white glitter. Awesome label and awesome performance.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Very popular artillery firework kit. So popular we do not even have a video of this product. We can't keep it in stock long enough. These shells are all about the color. Great color and a variety of shells keeps it interesting. This artillery kit features 24 shells - single, double, triple, and canister.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The #1 selling artillery shell firework of all time and for good reason. The Excalibur firework patented shells have a maximum 60g charge and are known for their quality, vibrant colors, huge and thunderous breaks. These artillery shells have been a favorite since they debuted over a decade ago. The pinnacle of the artillery shell world is often imitated but never duplicated. Excalibur is simply the best!</li>
