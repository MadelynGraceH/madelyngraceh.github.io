        <h1>All about Africa!</h1>
        <h1>Fun facts</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> Africa is the second largest continent in the world with a total area of around 11.73 million square miles (30.37 million square kilometers) that account for 5.7% of the earth’s surface as well as 20% of the total surface of land on our planet. It is divided up into five sub-sections; North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa and West Africa.  One of the most interesting facts about Africa is that the length and breadth of the continent are about the same, Horizontal Width: 4,355 miles (7,009 km) from Dakar, Senegal, east to Mogadishu, Somalia and Vertical Length: 4,504 miles (7,248 km) from Cape Town, South Africa north to Tripoli, Libya.<br>There are 54 countries and ten territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition. Sudan used to be the largest country in Africa until it was split into Sudan and South Sudan. Algeria is now the largest African country by geographical area. Cairo is the largest city, the capital city of Egypt.
Africa is often thought of as quite isolated from the rest of the world, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. Africa and Europe are separated by less than 9 miles at the Strait of Gibraltar, which separates Spain from Morocco, ferries are even available to take you from Africa to Europe or vice versa.
The African continent has the second largest population in the world, at 1,287,920,518 people approximately 16.87% of the world’s population (as of August 2018). It’s really no surprise that Africa is home to the most genetically diverse people on Earth as it is the 2nd largest continent.</li>
<br>
        
            <li>There are at least 3,000 distinct ethnic groups in Africa and around 2,000 different languages are spoken and each of them has different dialects. While Arabic is the language that is most widely spoken in the African continent, followed by English and Swahili, French respectively.<br>If we go by the records of the fossil remains Africa seems to be the first continent where humans were found. The fossil remains have suggested that humans had inhabited the African continent around 7 million years ago.
</li>
<br>
<li>The Nile River is the longest river in the world, is approximately 4,258 miles (6,853 kilometers) long and passes Flowing northward through through 11 countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt.</li>
<br>
<li>The oldest existing, and continually operating educational institution in the world is the University of Karueein, ( Athen’s of Africa) founded in 859 AD by Fatima al-Fihri in Fez, Morocco and was originally a madrassa. The University of Bologna, Italy, was founded in 1088 and is the oldest one in Europe.</li>
<br>
<li>Mansa Musa, or Musa I of Mali is considered one of the richest men in history. Musa was the tenth emperor of the Mali Empire, one of the prosperous Sahelian kingdoms that developed along the Saharan slave trade routes in the later medieval period.
By the time of his death in 1937, estimates place his net worth in the range of US$300 billion to US$400 billion in adjusted dollars for the late 2000s</li>

   <h1>Animals that live in Africa</h1>
   <ul>
       <li>Giraffe. The giraffe is the world’s tallest animal, and well known for its long legs and neck. From head to toe, a mature giraffe’s height is from 14 to 19 feet, and the animal weighs from 1,750 to 2,800 pounds, according to National Geographic (NG). It has a brown mane on the neck, and its head has two hairy horns. The giraffe’s coat has brown patches stained with black, which are separated by a beige coloration. It’s herbivorous, and feeds on leaves, tree buds, and shoots from trees like the Acacia, and other thorny plants and grasses in smaller quantities. The giraffe is found in such African countries as Kenya, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Uganda, South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. These countries have wild grassland plains, woodlands, and the savannas which are suited for them. A giraffe is social, and females live in groups of 10 to 12 animals. When happy, giraffes will gallop and engage in playful behavior. A male reaches sexual maturity at 7 years, and a female at 4 years. Their average lifespan is 25 years. According to Giraffe Conservation Foundation, less than 80,000 giraffes remain globally.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Lemur. The lemur is a primate with a long, bushy, black and white ringed tail. It has a dog-like snout, nose, and lips, its eyelids are dark, and its furred ears are white. The Lemur’s thick fur is grayish-brown on the back, and grey on the limbs and rump. Its underside has a mixture of white, grey, and cream colors, according to ARKive Initiative (AI). The lemur’s face is white, and the eyes are surrounded by dark patches, and the upper part of the forelimbs have grayish-white fur, while the paws and feet are dark. It weighs 5 to 5.7 pounds. The lemur’s tail length is 55 centimeters, and its head and body length is 8.5 to 45.5 centimeters, according to National Geographic. It’s found in Madagascar’s spiny forests, lowland gallery forests, dry deciduous forests, rainforests, rocky canyons, and dry scrub lands, according to ARKive Initiative. In these habitats, it feeds on fruits, leaves, flowers, stems, spiders, caterpillars, cicadas, insect cocoons, birds, chameleons, and grasshoppers. Lemurs live in troops that can comprise of 6 to 30 of them each. They are ferocious in protecting their territory, and use their odor as a defense mechanism. Sexual maturity for a lemur starts at 2.5 to 3 years of age. In the wild, a lemur can live on average 18 years, according to National Geographic.</li>
       <br>
       <li>African Elephant. The African elephant is the largest land animal on earth, with two subspecies. These are the Forest and the Savanna African elephants. Its height to shoulder height ranges from 8.2 to 13 feet, and weighs 5,000 to 14,000 pounds, according to National Geographic. The African elephant's length from head to rump is 19 to 24 feet, according to World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Its wrinkled coat is gray in color, and is covered with sparse fur. The African elephant has a trunk to smell, breath, drink water, and grab objects like food. African elephant populations lie to the south of the Sahara Desert in the Eastern, Central, Southern, and Western Africa countries like Kenya, Guinea, Niger, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe, and others. Habitats suited for African elephants are the grasslands and acacia savanna, miombo woodlands, and forested regions, wherein they feed on up to 300 pounds of foods like roots, grasses, fruit, tree barks, and leaves daily, according to National Geographic. The African elephant lives in herds of around 10, comprising of males and females separately. At times, several family units join to form a clan of around 70 elephants, each led by a female, according to World Wide Fund for Nature. African elephants achieve sexual maturity at 10 to 12 years, according to Animal Diversity (AD). In the wild, they have an average lifespan of up to 70 years, according to National Geographic.

   <h1>Why Africa makes a great place to travel</h1>
   <ul>
       <li>Africa certainly has a lot of beaches making it impossible to choose the absolute best, though a top pick would be the beaches on the small island of Zanzibar, just off the coast from the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam.

This small island boasts clear azure waters, coral white sand and plenty of diving and snorkelling opportunities, and is the perfect place to relax after completing a safari or trek up Africa’s highest peaks, Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya.

Other pristine beaches include Camps Bay, Cape Town’s most popular beach on the edge of a trendy suburb lined with cafe’s and bars and the Skeleton Coast, possibly the world’s most hauntingly beautiful stretch of beach and graveyard for ships across in Namibia.</li>
<br>
<li>Africa is a melting pot of the ancient and cosmopolitan cities.

Explore Morocco’s Marrakesh, a densely packed, medieval city that dates back to the Berber empire. The maze of alleys and thriving markets evokes images of Disney’s Aladdin and you’ll be hard-pressed shaking the image of a magic carpet from your mind as you browse hundreds of intricately hand-woven rugs from the eclectic souks.

In contrast, South Africa’s Cape Town is a modern cosmopolitan city that boasts a spectacular coastline and rich cultural heritage and history. The city is undeniably beautiful both for its setting against one of the new seven wonders of nature, Table Mountain, as well as its regeneration of industrial districts, Dutch, Malay & British influenced architecture, & historic buildings.</li>
<br>
<li>Visit the world’s highest sand dunes in the Namib desert, witness the world’s largest and most powerful waterfall, Victoria Falls in Zambia/Zimbabwe, and explore the lush water world of the Okavango Delta in Botswana.

Discover Ngorongoro Crater, a UNESCO World Heritage Site of the world’s largest unbroken, un-flooded volcanic caldera; or even stopover at Fish River Canyon, the second largest river canyon in the world (after the Grand Canyon).

With a wonderful variety of wildlife, culture and adventure, the African continent will deliver truly unforgettable experiences.</li>
<br>
<li>Camping in Africa is an invigorating experience; it offers a close connection to the land, nature and wildlife (we’re talking birds and beetles – not buffalo and lions). So, what better way for a truly immersive way to experience Africa?

The best thing about camping in Africa is that there are many grades of camping, so it’s not all bush tents and bare essentials – though there is that too! Whether you’re keen on pitching a tent to experience the outdoors first-hand, want that little bit of luxury, like bush showers attached to your campsite and fully serviced camping, or high-end camping in luxurious dome tents with full bedding and an ensuite, Africa offers it all.</li>
<br>
<li>Though not commonly associated with the country’s dry landscape, there are plenty of water based activities, including canoeing down the mighty Zambezi, white water rafting on Kenya’s River Tana, exploring the wildlife-rich Okavango Delta by mokoro, and canoeing down Manambolo River in Madagascar brimming with endemic birds and enter the spectacular and little-visited Manambolo Gorge through a limestone plateau. It's a great alternative to the usual game drive safari experience.

If your inner water-child is calling for a trip with water activities, Africa has all you need and more.</li>
